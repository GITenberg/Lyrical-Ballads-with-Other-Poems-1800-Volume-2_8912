description: "Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems is a collection of poems by\
  \ William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, first published in 1798 and generally\
  \ considered to have marked the beginning of the English Romantic movement in literature.\
  \ The immediate effect on critics was modest, but it became and remains a landmark,\
  \ changing the course of English literature and poetry.\nMost of the poems in the\
  \ 1798 edition were written by Wordsworth, with Coleridge contributing only four\
  \ poems to the collection, including one of his most famous works, \"The Rime of\
  \ the Ancient Mariner\".\nA second edition was published in 1800, in which Wordsworth\
  \ included additional poems and a preface detailing the pair's avowed poetical principles.\
  \ For another edition, published in 1802, Wordsworth added an appendix titled Poetic\
  \ Diction in which he expanded the ideas set forth in the preface.\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
